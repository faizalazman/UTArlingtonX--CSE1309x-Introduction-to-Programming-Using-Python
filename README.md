Course start date: Jan. 15, 2018

Course end date:   Apr. 15, 2018

This course is an introduction to Python programming language. The course is open to all learners who hope to gain an understanding of the basic components of computer programming. No previous knowledge of programming is required.

You will learn basic concepts and terminologies such as variables, operators, expressions, conditional statements, loops, and functions. Lessons include videos, notes, solutions, references, tables, and exercises.The exercises in each lesson are based on interactive hands-on questions and programming practices. These exercises are designed to help you understand the components of Python language while incrementally improving your analytical and programming skills. Exercises are not graded, they do not have due dates, and they are available at all times.

There are also graded modules which include 4 assignments, 6 quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam.  In order to earn a certificate you must have a score greater than 60% in the graded modules
